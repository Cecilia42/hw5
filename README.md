In my project, I made a catching game which is catching fries by mouth. When the player press the arrows on the 
keyborad, the mouth will move to catch the fries and the fries will drops randomly from the top of the screen. 
As long as the mouth eats the fries the music will play and a new fries will appears on the screen. When player 
doesn't catches the fries, the game ends.
